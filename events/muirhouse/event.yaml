description: A hustings for Edinburgh West constituency, specifically Muirhouse. Focusing
  on housing and community. Muirhouse is one of the poorest areas in Edinburgh and
  the poorest in this seat. Historically the community feel abandoned with poor housing,
  and problems engaging with the council around repairs. Also, there is a complete
  lack of services such as shops, cafes, pubs, places for people to meet, with nothing
  for children and young adults to do outside of school. The area, on the whole, is
  run down, with public play areas in a bad state of repair and drug paraphernalia
  scattered around. There is a lot of rubbish strewn around and the area is,  quite
  frankly, depressing. We want to know what the candidates are willing to do to improve
  the lives of those who live in the Muirhouse community.
