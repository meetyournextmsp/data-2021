  \ we have organised an online hustings event for local autistic people, families\
  \ and supporters in South Lanarkshire.\r\n\r\nWe believe very strongly that it is\
  \ important that autistic people and their allies have an opportunity to contribute\
  \ to the debate ahead of this important election and ask questions to representatives\
  \ from the major political parties. The hustings will take place on Tuesday 27th\
  \ April 6pm-7.30pm via Zoom and will include a 5 minute comfort break. \r\n\r\n\
  The hustings will be Chaired by Andrew Crosbie and David Weir, Co-Chairs of National\
  \ Autistic Society Scotland\u2019s South Lanarkshire Branch, and they will be joined\
  \ by representatives from the major political parties including: Eric Holford (Scottish\
  \ Conservatives), Gillian Mackay (Scottish Green Party), Monique McAdams (Scottish\
  \ Labour), Paul McGarry (Scottish Liberal Democrats), and Collette Stevenson (Scottish\
